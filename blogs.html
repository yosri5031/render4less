            <p>3D rendering is the process of converting 3D models into 2D images on a computer. It is widely used in various industries such as architecture, movies, video games, and simulations. The process involves adding lighting, shading, and textures to a 3D model to create a lifelike image or animation.</p>
            <p>There are two main types of rendering: real-time and pre-rendering. Real-time rendering is used in interactive environments like video games, where images need to be generated quickly. Pre-rendering is used for high-quality images in movies and architectural visualizations, where time is less of a constraint.</p>
            <p>Advancements in technology have significantly improved rendering techniques, allowing for more realistic and complex visualizations. Software like Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max are popular tools used by professionals in the field.</p>
